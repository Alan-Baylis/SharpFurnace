# SharpFurnace
C# source code for running a Paleomag Furnace directly from a Windows PC and Measurement Computing DAQ Thermocouple Analog Input device without the use of a thermocouple controller.  This software uses the Digital Output Channels on the DAQ device to directly control the Furnace's heating element power supplies. Please check with the owners of this repository before attempting to run this software with your Furnace. Your hardware will need to have independent safeguard circuits added to it to prevent hardware damage, fire, injury, or death. A Paleomag Furnace is not a toy; it is an infernal death machine that has just barely been tricked into doing science.
